## Aligning modes of instruction and assessments to ILOs

*How assignments, modes of instruction and assessments are related to the intended learning outcomes, and demonstrates that the intended learning outcomes are fully covered in a valid and reliable manner.*

<!-- Give me a short introductory paragraph on what constructive alignment is and why it is imperative for learning. -->

Constructive alignment is an educational approach that involves aligning learning outcomes, teaching methods, and assessment practices to ensure that students achieve the intended goals of a course. According to Biggs and Tang (2011), it is imperative for learning because it helps to create a clear and focused learning experience for students by linking all aspects of the educational process, from the desired learning outcomes to the evaluation of student achievement. This helps to ensure that students have a clear understanding of what they are expected to learn and how their progress will be assessed, and it enables teachers to design more effective and engaging learning experiences.

Following Bloom's taxonomy, @sec-ilos presents the ILOs in an ascending level of complexity regarding order thinking skills.
In summary, students are expected to be able to discuss relevant topics in the context of warehousing to support decision-making, apply quantitative optimization methods, analyze operational data to evaluate performance, and synthesize research to derive best practices.

Since assuming a direct correspondence between Bloom's Taxonomy action verbs and learning outcomes' complexity may be misleading (see @newtonPragmaticMasterList2020), for clarity, Table @tbl-ilo-teach-assessment maps ILOs to assessment types, giving meaning to the outcome and determining its usefulness in the context of the course.

<!-- N.B. Ensure the Bloom’s verb actually aligns type of activity and assessment. -->
