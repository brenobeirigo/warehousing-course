## Teaching logistics

In the following sections, we describe the workload per activity of the educational team, which is comprised of three lecturers and three teaching assistants (TAs). @sec-teacher-workload and @sec-ta-workload lay out the workload per activity and workload split of teachers and TAs, respectively.

Finally, @sec-coordinator-workload describes workload related to coordination activities.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
To estimate exam- and assignment-related activities, we assume the typical number of students (around **90**) enroll in the course. Additionally, we group the workload of administrative- and communication-related activities per week, such that these are always multiplied by **10** (the course duration in weeks).

<!--
*Both lecturer and student activities (e. g., grading, giving feedback) can be dealt with realistically in the available time.*

-   This can be incorporated into the above paragraph, but you could make this very clear by making a type of time line with the various activities that you and the students undertake over the 10 weeks. Include the "behind the scene tasks" such as lesson preparation, setting of exams, marking, etc.
-   Reflect on your workload and your practice.
-   Do you have any goals to improve or insights you gained?

### Teaching workload {#sec-teacher-workload}

@tbl-teacher-workload shows the breakdown of the teacher workload per activity. Activities are grouped into five main clusters:

-   Lecture
-   Group assignment
-   Quiz
-   Exam
-   Admin/Communication



| Activity cluster    | Activity                  | Number | Duration (h) | Workload (h) |

: Teaching workload split per activity. {#tbl-teacher-workload}

In @fig-warehousing_teacher_workload, it can be seen that activities related to lecturing occupy most of the teacher time.

However, this prominence of lecturing-related activities is temporary: once the course is run for the second time, the prepared material can be re-used.

Activities related to lecturing feature the highest workload.

### Teaching assistant (TA) workload {#sec-ta-workload}

@tbl-ta-workload shows the breakdown of the teaching assistance workload. To estimate exam- and assignment-related activities, we assume the typical number of students (around 90) enroll in the course. In total, we expect to request a maximum of **169 TA hours**, which will be divided among three TAs.

| Activity                              | Number                         | Duration (h) | Workload (h) |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Assist in practical lesson (in class) | 8                              | 2            | 16           |
| Prepare for practical                 | 8                              | 2            | 16           |
| Assist in quiz evaluation (in class)  | 4                              | 2            | 8            |
| Process quiz results                  | 4                              | 1            | 4            |
| Grade assignment                      | 120[^1e2_teaching_logistics-1] | 0.5          | 60           |
| Answer assignment-related questions   | 10                             | 1            | 10           |
| Grade exam                            | 90                             | 0.5          | 45           |
| Manage Canvas, buffer                 | 10                             | 1            | 10           |
|                                       |                                | **Total**    | **169**      |

: Expected teaching assistant workload. {#tbl-ta-workload}

[^1e2_teaching_logistics-1]: Assignments are carried out by groups of 3 students, thus 4 assignments $\times$ 30 groups = 120

Activities are divided according to TA's availability and aptitude (previous performance in the course). @tbl-ta-workload-split shows the workload split among the three TAs.

In summary:

-   **TA 1** assists in 2 practicals, grades 1 assignment, and grades the exams.
-   **TA 2** assists in 6 practicals and grades 3 assignments.
-   **TA 3** Assists in all quizzes and manages Canvas.

| Activity                              | TA 1 (h) | TA 2 (h) | TA 3 (h) |
|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Assist in practical lesson (in class) | 4        | 12       |          |
| Prepare for practical                 | 4        | 12       |          |
| Assist in quiz evaluation (in class)  |          |          | 8        |
| Process quiz results                  |          |          | 4        |
| Grade assignment                      | 15       | 45       |          |
| Answer assignment-related questions   | 3        | 7        |          |
| Grade exam                            | 45       |          |          |
| Manage Canvas, buffer                 |          |          | 10       |
| **Total**                             | 71       | 76       | 22       |
