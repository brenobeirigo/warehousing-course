## Teaching logistics

*Both lecturer and student activities (e. g., grading, giving feedback) can be dealt with realistically in the available time.*

- This can be incorporated into the above paragraph, but you could make this very clear by making a type of time line with the various activities that you and the students undertake over the 10 weeks. Include the “behind the scene tasks” such as lesson preparation, setting of exams, marking, etc.
- Reflect on your workload and your practice.
- Do you have any goals to improve or insights you gained?
