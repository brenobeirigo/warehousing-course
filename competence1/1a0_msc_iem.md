**Warehousing** is a mandatory course of the *Manufacturing Logistics (ML)* orientation within the *Production and Logistics Management (PLM)* specialization of the *Master (of Science) program Industrial Engineering and Management (M-IEM)* program^[See [M-IEM program-specific Education and Examination Regulations (EER)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/education/regulations/2022-2023-eng/eer-master-2022-2023/11086-psa-m-iem-2022-2023.pdf)].

> The PLM specialization focuses on designing and managing logistics and supply chain processes.

The M-IEM degree has a study load of 120 ECs and comprises a set of mandatory courses/activities at program, specialization, and orientation levels.
@tbl-overview-mandatory-courses presents such courses for M-IEM/PLM/ML (totaling 75 ECs). The rest of the study load is divided among elective courses (45 ECs) and the graduation thesis (30 ECs).

## Recommended course schedules {#recommended_course_schedules}

The first 1.5 years of M-IEM focus on teaching and learning activities, whereas the last semester is fully dedicated to the graduation project of 30 EC.
Since efficient and cost-effective warehousing operations are frequently on-demand in industry, there is a wealth of opportunities to conduct the graduation project in several organizations (see a complete list of MSc theses on warehousing in @sec-warehousing-theses).

@tbl-recommended_schedules summarizes the recommended schedules for M-IEM/PLM/ML mandatory courses. Notice that students starting the program in September (@tbl-recommended_schedules_sep) will have already covered most of the program's disciplines by the time the **Warehousing** course starts.
