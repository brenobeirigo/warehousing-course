## Learning outcomes in the context of the program competences

```{=html}
<!--*An explanation on how the intended learning outcomes of the course contribute to the outcomes or competences of the degree program.*

- Describe how the course ILOs contribute to the module and programme outcomes.
- Enhance this by making a table or show a diagram how the Programme learning objectives flow to the module learning objectives flow to the course learning objectives.
- This shows the common thread and how you have carefully considered this when designing.

The M-IEM program aims at educating students to become well-rounded industrial engineers and managers. M-IEM graduates can quickly identify, thoroughly comprehend, critically assess, correctly apply, and creatively integrate existing scientific knowledge to analyze problems and design solutions (see the detailed program ILOs in @sec-ilos_miem).

@tbl-cross_ilos shows how the **Warehousing** course learning outcomes underpin M-IEM competencies, providing quantitative and qualitative methods to design, manage, control, and evaluate contemporary warehouses.

Once the course is mandatory for M-IEM PLC urse within the PLC track, all its learning objectives are strongly related to the program's competency A7, which entails mastering M-IEM core disciplines. Also, since all course content is fine-tuned to real-world study cases, all learning objectives address competency A4 conceptually or through practical examples. In special, learning outcomes W1, W2, W3, and W4 entail mastering topics within Warehousing, a pre-requisite to critically analyzing and framing concrete situations.

Conversely, W5, W6, and W7 focus on learning state-of-the-art methods to optimize warehouses at different planning levels. W5 and W6 are strongly related to A3 and A5, respectively, focusing on implementing and evaluating quantitative methods, whereas W7 addresses the research components of the program (ILOs A1, A2, and A8).

Finally, contributing to meaningful research (A8) in the context of warehousing requires a grasp of all course ILOs, especially W7.
