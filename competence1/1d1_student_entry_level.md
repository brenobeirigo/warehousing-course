## Student entry level

<!--
*An explanation on how the entry level (e.g. prior knowledge, earlier educational experiences) of students is addressed, as well as how the knowledge and interest of the students are taken into account when designing the course.*

- Here, make assumptions of what you expect students to have already learnt – back this up by explaining what they have learnt in previous modules/courses.  Also, you can mention any other support you offer to facilitate learning – e.g. extra or supplementary reading material on canvas, booster session, etc.
- If you don’t know – go and speak to colleagues from previous modules. Tell us who and what you asked and what you found out.

The **Warehousing** course happens every Q4 of the M-IEM program (see the [recommended course schedules](#recommended_course_schedules)).
Therefore, students of the _Manufacturing Logistics (ML)_ orientation within the _Production and Logistics Management (PLM)_ specialization starting either in February (Q3) or September (Q1) will have already be familiar with the course pre-requisites, namely:

- *Elementary computer programming:* if-then-else statements, for/while loops, local/global variables, functions, and procedures. (part of IEMs' [BSc](https://osiris.utwente.nl/student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=202000392&collegejaar=2022&taal=en) and [Pre-MSc](https://osiris.utwente.nl/student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=202000452&collegejaar=2022&taal=en) program.)
- *Operations research techniques:* Mathematical programming/model formulation. (covered during Q1 or Q3 by the [_Operations Research techniques I_](https://osiris.utwente.nl/student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=201800003&collegejaar=2022&taal=en) of the M-IEMs program.)

Additionally, knowledge of handling and processing data is helpful in completing the assignments.
Therefore, students starting the MSc program in Q4 would have already attended the [_Data Science_](https://osiris.utwente.nl/student/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursus=201400174&collegejaar=2022&taal=en) course (lectured in Q2), having an edge on students starting on Q3.
In order to make up for this knowledge gap, assignments are adequately scaffolded such that only the warehousing-related topics require work.
