## Course practical details

<!-- The relevant conditions (e.g. EC’s, budget, roster, hours, place, location, type of meeting) are taken into account.

# Analysis of the context / start situation

- Describe the time elements: EC's, teacher hours, contact time
- Describe the resources: budget, rooms, equipment, etc.
- Describe other relevant conditions: Student Assistants commitment, including teachers, etc.

# Coralie's comments
 
- Here, restate the ECs and the hours that go with that. You can show how you considered the students’ workload by using this calculator: [https://cte.rice.edu/workload/](https://cte.rice.edu/workload/) Perhaps make a nice table.
- Next, consider your time as a teacher (contact hours plus assessing, preparation, etc.) how does this fit into your allocated hours? Is it doable or is it too much burden on you and your colleagues – if so, what do you plan to do differently next year to  make it better?
- Tell us about the locations of your lectures in usual times and corona times – e.g. you need rooms with X,Y,Z due to a,b,c. During corona – what platform do you prefer? Why? How do you do it? (Video on, or just mic etc.?)
- Maybe you have different needs for the different types of meetings – depending on whether it is a tutorial, a workshop or a more traditional lecture?-->
