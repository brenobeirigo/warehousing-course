M-IEM graduates can quickly identify, thoroughly comprehend, critically assess, correctly apply, and creatively integrate existing scientific knowledge to analyze problems and design solutions (see the detailed program ILOs in Section 6.1).\nTable 1.3 shows how the Warehousing course learning outcomes underpin M-IEM competencies, providing quantitative and qualitative methods to design, manage, control, and evaluate contemporary warehouses.\nOnce the course is mandatory for M-IEM PLC urse within the PLC track, all its learning objectives are strongly related to the program’s competency A7, which entails mastering M-IEM core disciplines. Also, since all course content is fine-tuned to real-world study cases, all learning objectives address competency A4 conceptually or through practical examples. In special, learning outcomes W1, W2, W3, W4, and W5 entail mastering topics within Warehousing, a pre-requisite to critically analyzing and framing concrete situations.\nConversely, W6, W7, and W8 focus on learning state-of-the-art methods to optimize warehouses at different planning levels. W6 and W7 are strongly related to A3 and A5, respectively, focusing on implementing and evaluating quantitative methods, whereas W8 addresses the research components of the program (ILOs A1, A2, and A8).\nFinally, contributing to meaningful research (A8) in the context of warehousing requires a grasp of all course ILOs, especially W8.\n\n\n\nTable 1.3: MSc IEM program ILOs (top) covered by the Warehousing course ILOs (left).

In conclusion, the MSc course in warehousing and its learning outcomes are directly relevant to the warehousing industry in the Netherlands, providing students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in a critical and rapidly evolving sector of the country’s economy.\n\n1.4.1 Warehousing market in the Netherlands\nThe Netherlands is a major logistics and supply chain management hub with a well-developed warehousing industry that plays a critical role in the country’s economy. The number of warehouses in the country has been consistently growing (see Figure 1.1), to keep up with the latest trends towards online shopping, digitalization, and same- or next-day delivery. Many companies in the Netherlands operate large warehousing facilities to support their supply chain operations, including major retailers, manufacturers, and logistics.\nConsequently, the demand for skilled professionals in the field of warehousing is high, and many companies are seeking individuals with advanced knowledge and skills in warehouse design, operation, and management.\n\nGiven the diversity of the Dutch market, M-IEM students willing to carry out their graduation projects in warehousing related-subjects may choose from a wealth of companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Annual take-up4 rate for warehouses in the Netherlands from 2014 to 2021, by city (source: Statista).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Word cloud produced using M-IEM theses titles.
