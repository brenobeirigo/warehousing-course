    "text": "Research\nMy interest in the optimization field was sparked in 2011 when I first moved to the Netherland for a one-year exchange program at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Assen. By then, besides following the “Advanced Sensor Applications” program, I was puzzled by a classical optimization problem when planning my summer vacations: visiting as many western European cities as possible within a month under my meager student budget. In the end, the travel was terrific (my friends and I visited about thirteen destinations), but the planning phase was very laborious, and the itinerary was, most likely, far from optimal.\nGoing back to Brazil, I took advantage of my frustration to design and solve a travel planning problem, which became the topic of both my graduation project and my MSc dissertation thesis. In parallel with my master’s degree, I worked as a lecturer at the Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG). By then, I was teaching IT-related topics (e.g., automation via web, android development, web design) daily for a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering and an IT technical degree.\nAt the end of 2016, I stop lecturing at CEFET-MG to pursue a Ph.D. at TU Delft. I worked within the “Dynamic Fleet Management” module of the Integrated Cooperative Automated Vehicle (I-CAVE) project, a multi-disciplinary and cross-university joint effort covering all research fields related to developing and deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs). My thesis, “Dynamic Fleet Management for Autonomous Vehicles: Learning- and Optimization-Based Strategies,” focuses on addressing the logistical challenges and opportunities arising from adopting shared AV fleets in urban environments. It presents a series of strategies to guarantee service quality throughout operational scenarios throughout the timeline of AV technology deployment.\nIn my postdoctoral research, the focus has changed from surface streets to water: I worked on the Transportation and Logistics Over Water (TRiLOGy) project. This project aims at improving city livability by efficiently using urban waterways for mobility and logistics applications. My research was mainly concerned with designing optimization models that can leverage stochasticity in the demand and network conditions to route and schedule hybrid (over water and land) fleets of (autonomous) vehicles. Also, we worked closely with Amsterdam Municipality to design dynamic stochastic algorithms for managing fleets of autonomous vessels to (partially) carry out the city’s day-to-day logistics services, such as waste collection and freight delivery."

    "text": "Education\n\nI enjoy teaching because it allows me to witness first-hand students’ skill acquisition process (improving how they solve problems) while honing my skills as an educator, presenter, and researcher.\n\nThroughout my work as a:\n\nfull-time lecturer at the Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG) in Brazil,\nsupervisor of master students at TU Delft, and\nmentor of an early-stage Ph.D. student at TU Delft,\n\nI earned extensive pedagogical experience in the design and conduct of a range of different courses and daily interaction with a diverse body of students from different educational backgrounds.\n\nTeaching\nBefore starting my doctoral studies, I worked for 1.5 years (40h/week) at CEFET-MG in the Department of Informatics, teaching computer science disciplines for a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering (4 one-semester courses) and a career-focused IT technical degree (2 one-year courses). Teaching day-by-day to 50+ students at different levels (high-schoolers and bachelors) taught me that fulfilling the learning objectives is rooted in organization, clarity, and, most importantly, contextualization.\nI foster student engagement by tailoring the content to guarantee that they quickly recognize its relevance and applicability. For example, the lessons of my “Web Development” course focused on recreating the features of students’ everyday social networks, such as Instagram photo filters or Facebook-inspired databases and user interfaces. Further, when teaching “Automation via Web,” I assisted student groups in designing practical projects that embodied all the learning objectives. This way, they could use their creativity to develop applications appealing to them (e.g., a web-controlled home automation system) while practicing the course’s concepts.\nTo improve content retention, I seek to include plenty of examples and eye-pleasing visualizations in my lectures. I painstakingly prepare slides to ensure a clear and intuitive message gets across and design interactive assignments to illustrate concepts vividly. Still, I am aware these are supportive materials and regard my teacher role as a “tour guide” that enthusiastically contextualizes the content. My students have always deemed me friendly and rigorous, with high standards and expectations. This attitude translates to being approachable and providing detailed feedback in reports and assignments, both in the classroom and as a supervisor.\n\n\nSupervision\nAt TU Delft, I proposed and supervised MSc graduation projects and literature/research assignments spun off from my work on transportation and, more recently, working as a teaching assistant in the course “Machine Learning for Transport and Multi-Machine Systems.” As a supervisor, I seek to tailor the topic and the approach to fit the students’ aspirations and preferences, helping them develop a feasible plan to achieve their goals while delivering quality work that complies with the program’s requirements. To ensure they are on track and focused, I adopt an Agile methodology of continuous and iterative improvement through constant feedback."

M-IEM graduates can quickly identify, thoroughly comprehend, critically assess, correctly apply, and creatively integrate existing scientific knowledge to analyze problems and design solutions (see the detailed program ILOs in Section 7.1).\nTable 2.3 shows how the Warehousing course learning outcomes underpin M-IEM competencies, providing quantitative and qualitative methods to design, manage, control, and evaluate contemporary warehouses.\nOnce the course is mandatory for M-IEM PLC urse within the PLC track, all its learning objectives are strongly related to the program’s competency A7, which entails mastering M-IEM core disciplines. Also, since all course content is fine-tuned to real-world study cases, all learning objectives address competency A4 conceptually or through practical examples. In special, learning outcomes W1, W2, W3, and W4 entail mastering topics within Warehousing, a pre-requisite to critically analyzing and framing concrete situations.\nConversely, W5, W6, and W7 focus on learning state-of-the-art methods to optimize warehouses at different planning levels. W5 and W6 are strongly related to A3 and A5, respectively, focusing on implementing and evaluating quantitative methods, whereas W7 addresses the research components of the program (ILOs A1, A2, and A8).\nFinally, contributing to meaningful research (A8) in the context of warehousing requires a grasp of all course ILOs, especially W7.\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: MSc IEM program ILOs (top) covered by the Warehousing course ILOs (left).

The course also helps students stay informed about the latest research and developments in the field, equipping them to make informed decisions and contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of warehousing operations.\n\n\n2.3.2 Warehousing industry\nGraduates of the MSc course in warehousing are well-prepared to meet this demand. They are equipped with a thorough understanding of the latest research and best practices in the field and the knowledge and skills needed to analyze data, optimize warehouse operations, and make informed decisions.\nThey are also well-positioned to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the warehousing industry in the Netherlands. In conclusion, the MSc course in warehousing and its learning outcomes are directly relevant to the warehousing industry in the Netherlands, providing students with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in a critical and rapidly evolving sector of the country’s economy.\n\nWarehousing in the Netherlands\nThe Netherlands is a major logistics and supply chain management hub with a well-developed warehousing industry that plays a critical role in the country’s economy. Many companies in the Netherlands operate large warehousing facilities to support their supply chain operations, including major retailers, manufacturers, and logistics. Consequently, the demand for skilled professionals in the field of warehousing is high, and many companies are seeking individuals with advanced knowledge and skills in warehouse design, operation, and management.\n\nGiven the diversity of the Dutch market, M-IEM students willing to carry out their graduation projects in warehousing related-subjects may choose from a wealth of companies.\n\nThe number of warehouses in the country has been consistently growing, to keep up with the latest trends towards online shopping, digitalization, and same- or next-day delivery. As can be seen in Figure 2.1, the take-up4 rate for warehouses increased markedly since 2014, and is recently more prominent in the south of the country (Brabant province). For example, in 2022, bol.com has doubled the area of its fulfillment center in Waalwijk, Brabant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDutch warehouse annual take-up rate in square meters.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Annual take-up rate for warehouses in the Netherlands from 2014 to 2021, by city (source: Statista).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Word cloud produced using M-IEM theses titles.

    "text": "3.3 Aligning modes of instruction and assessments to ILOs\nHow assignments, modes of instruction and assessments are related to the intended learning outcomes, and demonstrates that the intended learning outcomes are fully covered in a valid and reliable manner.\n\nConstructive alignment is an educational approach that involves aligning learning outcomes, teaching methods, and assessment practices to ensure that students achieve the intended goals of a course. According to Biggs and Tang (2011), it is imperative for learning because it helps to create a clear and focused learning experience for students by linking all aspects of the educational process, from the desired learning outcomes to the evaluation of student achievement. This helps to ensure that students have a clear understanding of what they are expected to learn and how their progress will be assessed, and it enables teachers to design more effective and engaging learning experiences.\nFollowing Bloom’s taxonomy, Section 3.2 presents the ILOs in an ascending level of complexity regarding order thinking skills. In summary, students are expected to be able to discuss relevant topics in the context of warehousing to support decision-making, apply quantitative optimization methods, analyze operational data to evaluate performance, and synthesize research to derive best practices.\nSince assuming a direct correspondence between Bloom’s Taxonomy action verbs and learning outcomes’ complexity may be misleading (see Newton, Da Silva, and Peters (2020)), for clarity, Table Table 3.1 maps ILOs to assessment types, giving meaning to the outcome and determining its usefulness in the context of the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Learning activities and assessment associated to ILOs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntended Learning Outcome\nImportance\nQuiz (15%)\nIndividual report (15%)\nGroup assignment (20%)\nExam (50%)\nLearning activity\n\n\n\n\n1.

In order to make up for this knowledge gap, assignments are adequately scaffolded such that only the warehousing-related topics require work."

Grades will be carried on.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7.1 Individual report (15%)\nEach student is expected to write a 1000-word report (in the style of a blog post) on the warehousing operations of a company in the Netherlands. Companies will be initially assigned to students but they can change their target company later, provided that it does not coincide with other students’ companies.\nThe final grade comprises two main parts.\n\nPart I - Research (10%)\nStudents will be asked to provide specific details on several aspects of their target company warehousing operations (e.g., location, industry type, distribution strategy, material handling system). These details must be referenced accordingly (e.g., company website, articles, books).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf information on a certain warehousing category can not be found, students may consider the information of the “best-in-class” company in the same industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart II - Report (5%)\nUsing the information gathered in part 1, students should write a 1000-word report on the warehousing activities of their target company following a template provided by the teacher.\n\n\n\n6.1.7.2 Group assignments (20%)\nThere are four group assignments (max. 3 students), each accounting for 5% of the final grade. Assignments aim at exercising the quantitative nature of the course main modules. Table 6.1 shows the assignments’ estimated workload (viz., 6 hours per student).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe practicals will be focused primarily on providing assistance to solve assignments’ questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7.3 Quizzes (15%)\nThere are four 10-question multiple-choice quiz exams. Quizzes consist of three steps:\n\nIndividual quiz-exam (20 min): Each student work on quiz-questions individually.\nTeam formation (5 min): Students are (randomly) grouped in teams (5-7 students).\nTeam discussion (25 min): Each team considers the same questions again, negotiates the best alternative, and agrees on the final answer.\n\n\n6.1.7.3.1 Grading policy\nQuiz grades are calculated as the weighted sum of points earned individually and as a team: \\[\n\\text{Quiz points} = 0.5 * \\text{Individual points} + 0.5 * \\text{Team points}.\n\\] Three out of the four quizzes will account for the final grade (the three highest outcomes will be considered). For example, in the example shown in Table 6.2, quiz 2 is eliminated, such that the final grade is 13.5 out of 15 quiz points.\n\n\nTable 6.2: Example of grade calculation for quizzes. The highest three grades, namely, 1, 3, and 4 are used to compute final points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Quiz\nIndividual grade\nteam grade\nQuiz grade\nPoints earned\n\n\n\n\n1\n10\n10\n10 (\\(5 + 5\\))\n5\n\n\n2\n5\n7\n6 \\((2.5 + 3.5)\\)\ndiscarded\n\n\n3\n8\n8\n8 \\((4 + 4)\\)\n4\n\n\n4\n7\n3\n7 (\\(3.5 + 1.5\\))\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents may miss a quiz: it will be automatically considered the lowest-grade quiz and not accounted in the final grade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.7.4 Final exam (50%)\nThe final exam covers the whole content of the course.

The student is able to:\n\nIdentify the various steps in performed research and design.\nProperly break up own research and design activities into sub-processes.\n\nThese processes are intertwined: Research is needed for producing knowledge that is used for designing solutions in a specific context. Such knowledge is produced in a purposeful and methodical way (using scientific research methods). It may or may not be generalizable knowledge.\n\n\nA2) Evaluate research & design processes\nThe student has an overview of quantitative and qualitative empirical research methods. The student is able to:\n\nCritically analyse performed research as to the methodological aspects.\nSelect an appropriate method and justify this choice for research to be performed.\nApply this method in relatively complex cases.\n\n\n\nA3) Model operational processes quantitatively\nThe student has a thorough overview of quantitative modelling techniques for operational processes in this domain. The student is able to:\n\nSelect appropriate modelling techniques and justify this choice.\nApply these techniques in relatively complex cases.\nCritically analyse the results of modelling activities.\n\n\n\nA4) Leverage existing knowledge in concrete cases\nIs able to integrate existing knowledge, modelling techniques, and research results for designing, validating, and selecting solutions in relatively complex cases. This is challenging, because existing knowledge may not fully apply to a specific situation, models are always stylized, empirical research always has limitations, and some aspects have been left out of scope from the beginning anyway.\n\n\nA5) Plan implementation methods and processes\nThe student has an overview of implementation methods and processes. The student is able to:\n\nCritically analyse ongoing or finished implementation processes.\nPlan globally an implementation process in a relatively complex case.\n\n\n\nA6) Evaluate solution strategies’ performance\nThe student has an overview of evaluation methods and techniques. The student is able to:\n\nCritically analyse the results of performed evaluations.\nSelect appropriate evaluation methods and justify this choice.\nCarry out an evaluation in relatively complex cases.\n\n\n\nA7) Demonstrate mastery of M-IEM’s core disciplines\nIn order to be able to meet these competencies, the graduate must have mastered a set of core disciplines in the specialisation domain.\n\n\nA8) Contribute to academic development\nThe student is able to contribute to the development of the academic profession by identifying generic consequences and implications from professional cases (for example, general presentations, write papers about design solutions)."
