# About me {.unnumbered}

<!-- Tell us a bit on your education and work experience and your passion projects. Also how or what you enjoy about being an educator. And anything else you want to share... -->

I am Breno Alves Beirigo, an Asst. Prof. in Stochastic *Operations Research (OR)* working at the University of Twente in the *Industrial Engineering and Business Information Systems (IEBIS)* department. For the last six years, I have worked at TU Delft (NL) in the *Transport Engineering and Logistics (TEL)* section of the *Maritime and Transport Technology (MTT)* department, where I carried out my postdoc and Ph.D. research. Previously, I pursued a BSc and MSc degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of ViÃ§osa (BR).

## Research

My interest in the optimization field was sparked in 2011 when I first moved to the Netherland for a one-year exchange program at the Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Assen. By then, besides following the "Advanced Sensor Applications" program, I was puzzled by a classical optimization problem when planning my summer vacations: visiting as many western European cities as possible within a month under my meager student budget. In the end, the travel was terrific (my friends and I visited about thirteen destinations), but the planning phase was very laborious, and the itinerary was, most likely, far from optimal.

Going back to Brazil, I took advantage of my frustration to design and solve a travel planning problem, which became the topic of both my graduation project and my MSc dissertation thesis. In parallel with my master's degree, I worked as a lecturer at the Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG). By then, I was teaching IT-related topics (e.g., automation via web, android development, web design) daily for a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering and an IT technical degree.

At the end of 2016, I stop lecturing at CEFET-MG to pursue a Ph.D. at TU Delft. I worked within the "Dynamic Fleet Management" module of the Integrated Cooperative Automated Vehicle (I-CAVE) project, a multi-disciplinary and cross-university joint effort covering all research fields related to developing and deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs). My thesis, "Dynamic Fleet Management for Autonomous Vehicles: Learning- and Optimization-Based Strategies," focuses on addressing the logistical challenges and opportunities arising from adopting shared AV fleets in urban environments. It presents a series of strategies to guarantee service quality throughout operational scenarios throughout the timeline of AV technology deployment.

In my postdoctoral research, the focus has changed from surface streets to water: I worked on the Transportation and Logistics Over Water (TRiLOGy) project. This project aims at improving city livability by efficiently using urban waterways for mobility and logistics applications. My research was mainly concerned with designing optimization models that can leverage stochasticity in the demand and network conditions to route and schedule hybrid (over water and land) fleets of (autonomous) vehicles. Also, we worked closely with Amsterdam Municipality to design dynamic stochastic algorithms for managing fleets of autonomous vessels to (partially) carry out the city's day-to-day logistics services, such as waste collection and freight delivery.

## Education

> I enjoy teaching because it allows me to witness first-hand students' skill acquisition process (improving how they solve problems) while honing my skills as an educator, presenter, and researcher.

Throughout my work as a:

- full-time lecturer at the Federal Center of Technological Education of Minas Gerais (CEFET-MG) in Brazil,
- supervisor of master students at TU Delft, and
- mentor of an early-stage Ph.D. student at TU Delft,

I earned extensive pedagogical experience in the design and conduct of a range of different courses and daily interaction with a diverse body of students from different educational backgrounds.

### Teaching

Before starting my doctoral studies, I worked for 1.5 years (40h/week) at CEFET-MG in the Department of Informatics, teaching computer science disciplines for a BSc in Mechatronics Engineering (4 one-semester courses) and a career-focused IT technical degree (2 one-year courses). Teaching day-by-day to 50+ students at different levels (high-schoolers and bachelors) taught me that fulfilling the learning objectives is rooted in organization, clarity, and, most importantly, contextualization.

I foster student engagement by tailoring the content to guarantee that they quickly recognize its relevance and applicability. For example, the lessons of my "Web Development" course focused on recreating the features of students' everyday social networks, such as Instagram photo filters or Facebook-inspired databases and user interfaces. Further, when teaching "Automation via Web," I assisted student groups in designing practical projects that embodied all the learning objectives. This way, they could use their creativity to develop applications appealing to them (e.g., a web-controlled home automation system) while practicing the course's concepts.

To improve content retention, I seek to include plenty of examples and eye-pleasing visualizations in my lectures. I painstakingly prepare slides to ensure a clear and intuitive message gets across and design interactive assignments to illustrate concepts vividly. Still, I am aware these are supportive materials and regard my teacher role as a "tour guide" that enthusiastically contextualizes the content. My students have always deemed me friendly and rigorous, with high standards and expectations. This attitude translates to being approachable and providing detailed feedback in reports and assignments, both in the classroom and as a supervisor.

### Supervision

At TU Delft, I proposed and supervised MSc graduation projects and literature/research assignments spun off from my work on transportation and, more recently, working as a teaching assistant in the course "Machine Learning for Transport and Multi-Machine Systems." As a supervisor, I seek to tailor the topic and the approach to fit the students' aspirations and preferences, helping them develop a feasible plan to achieve their goals while delivering quality work that complies with the program's requirements. To ensure they are on track and focused, I adopt an Agile methodology of continuous and iterative improvement through constant feedback.

## Teaching and supervision at UT

As a teacher at UT, I am responsible for two *Industrial Engineering and Management (IEM)* courses: *Warehousing* (MSc - 4th quarter) and *VBA/Excel* (BSc - 1st quarter and Pre=MSc - 2nd quarter).
These courses have a wealth of legacy material, having been lectured for experienced teachers for 5+ years, and present different challenges.
While *VBA/Excel* is (mainly) lectured to first-year students fresh from high school,  *Warehousing* is geared towards last-year MSc students on the verge of entering the job market.
Throughout this UTQ portfolio, I will show how I finetune my approach and materials to adequately cater to the needs and aspirations of these different student bodies.

Finally, as a supervisor, I am involved as a first/second supervisor in both BSc and MSc graduation projects.
I supervise students whose project topics lie at the intersection of OR/ML (methods) and transportation/warehousing (context).
