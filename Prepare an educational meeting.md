# Preparation of my educational meeting

A lesson plan, containing:
− Specific intended learning outcomes for the meeting
− The context of the meeting (course / module / series of meetings)
− An overview for the meeting, including: subjects, lecturer activities, student activities
 Materials for the meeting (e.g. exercises, slides, manual etc.)
 Justification of the lesson plan.


## The Lesson

Give a some background on the actual lesson. Where does it fit into the course as a whole, the aims, the students, location (online/in person?)
1. A clear explanation of the purpose and relevance of the teaching session to students.
2. A clear explanation of the subject matter and/or instructions towards students.
3. Real interaction with students in order to stimulate the learning process
4. A good and stimulating atmosphere − Skillful use of technical aids – attach slides, video link (if applicable) to the appendix

**Insert lesson plan** below. (Additionally, you can reuse the justifications in your lesson plan to explain why you implemented certain elements in your lesson design.)


## Justification

Tell me about why you choose to do certain things you do in the lesson – back up with theory – maybe Gagne’s 9 event, or Mayer’s 12 principles inspired you. Or you have your own way – do share!

You may well be able to pick up some pointers and justify your actions.

## Reflection on Lesson Plan

 If there were any points discussed about the lesson in our meeting, or perhaps you got feedback and change your lesson plan prior to the lesson – Note them here. Reflect upon points and set goal concrete goals to enhance your knowledge/practise for the future.  E.g. were your ILOs appropriate, maybe you found this exercise useful, maybe you have your own way of planning – share a small insight to your habits.
