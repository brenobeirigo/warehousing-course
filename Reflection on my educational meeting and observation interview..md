# Reflection on performance

A thorough reflection of the performance with points for improvement.

## Observing my own lesson

 [[JC(C5]](#_msoanchor_5)Tell me how it felt watching your own video – what did you do well, what could be improved? (Use your self-observation sheet for this)

Insert your observation sheet in Appendix and refer to it here.


## Observations by assessor

 [[JC(C6]](#_msoanchor_6)Insert assessors’ final PDF form here.

Tell us how you experienced the feedback moment. Select a few points to discuss from the observation sheet. E.g. you realised you were actually doing a good job, you got confirmation that you struggle with parts that other struggle with too, etc.

Then set a few concrete goals on what you want to work on.

**IF** you had an additional assignment given to you – refer to it here, reflect upon it. Attach it in the appendix and refer it here.
